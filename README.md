Hi everyone,

Some days ago, I started playing Dokkan with some friends, and we came up with the idea of doing themed runs with random teams and units, just for fun. To choose a random character, we would pick a number between 1 and the number of characters we had in that category, which was a very tedious and annoying method. I've been wanting to learn Angular for a while, and it was the perfect opportunity to create a mini-project that would make this process more enjoyable.

That's why I created this page with 2 game modes: one for generating a random category and getting several characters from that category, and another mode that involves choosing random units to form a team of 6, with each unit fitting into a different category. I know the page isn’t the most responsive or the prettiest, but it works, and I’m happy with the result. If you have any ideas for extra game modes, I’d be happy to add them to make the page even better.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy it =)
